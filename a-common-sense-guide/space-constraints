- Time complexity -> how fast an algorithm run
- Space complexity -> how much memory an algorithm consumes

- The example of coying an array from an old array is O(N). Then we see the array elements processed and
put back in the original array which is O(1) since no additional memory is used.

- Sometimes in the wild, you will see input memory factored into space complexity, fyi.
