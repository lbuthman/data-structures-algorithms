Hash tables can lookup a value at O(1). They also go by hashes, maps, hashmaps, dictionaries, and
associative arrays.

The process of taking characters and converting them to numbers is hashing.

Hash functions can be executed in many different ways like simply adding each number together or
multiplying them. All in all, a hash function must return the same values given the same input.

Trying to add data to a cell that is already filled is known as a collision. A classic way to handle
collisions is with "separate chaining", where a single value in a hash map is replaced with an array.
Because of separate chaining, our worst case scenario could be O(N) but typically a hash map will
be O(1)
